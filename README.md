Representation and processing of data in the space of spherical functions, applications in machine learning algorithms

### Abstract:
The thesis contains a theoretical analysis of new representation forms and extraction procedures of features from data defined over $\mathbb{S}^2$ space by means of spherical convolutional networks (SCNN) using the rotation group $SO(3)$. This work provides the theoretical analysis of the correlation function between the signals defined over $\mathbb{S}^2$, and thus, enables us to implement a SCNN being a natural extension of well-grounded CNN defined over $\mathbb{R}^n$. To this end, we first introduce the theory behind the spherical space $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the group of turns $SO(3)$, and then move toward the concepts of the fast Fourier transform, spherical harmonics and the D-Wigner function, while enduring the algorithm to be numerically economical. Furthermore, the present work provides a~comprehensive theoretical analysis of fundamental conditions that must be met by the function used for correlation analysis and the approximation error estimation. Finally yet importantly, the algorithm analysis provided in this thesis is supplemented with theoretical and numerical examples presenting the analysis of error convergence.
